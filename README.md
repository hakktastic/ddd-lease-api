# DDD Lease API

This project is a demonstration of implementing a Lease API using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and Event Driven
Architecture (EDA) with Spring Boot.

## üß† Background

This project was implemented following an event storming workshop by [@sadema1](https://gitlab.com/sadema1). The main
purpose is to
learn how to implement an event driven application in combination with DDD and Spring Boot Modulith.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Emphasizes the core domain and domain logic, focusing on complex business rules
- **Spring Modulith**: Implements modular architecture to enhance maintainability and scalability
- **Spring Events**: Enables decoupling between different parts of the system by allowing domain events to be published
  and consumed asynchronously, supporting a more reactive and loosely coupled architecture
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: promotes separation between the domain code (DDD) and external concerns, and the ability
  to
  alter the infrastructure or application without touching the domain layer
